# Eat-Da-Burger-NodeExpressHandlebars# Node Express Handlebars

## Overview

In this project, we are creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). We are following the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in our app, and Handlebars to generate our HTML.


## Technologies Used

* Node
* SQL
* Javascript
* AJAX/APIs
* Express 

## Challenges
The key for this project was to connect all the varioud files from backend and frontend.This helps us understand how data flows through different servers all around the world.
By compartmentalizing data into different files, the code becomes more readable and manageable.
